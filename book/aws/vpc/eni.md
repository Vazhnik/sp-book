An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network interface that you can attach to an
instance in an Amazon VPC. ENIs are only available within an Amazon VPC, and they are
associated with a subnet upon creation. They can have one public IP address and multiple
private IP addresses. If there are multiple private IP addresses, one of them is primary.
Assigning a second network interface to an instance via an ENI allows it to be dual-homed
(have network presence in different subnets). An ENI created independently of a particular
instance persists regardless of the lifetime of any instance to which it is attached; if an
underlying instance fails, the IP address may be preserved by attaching the ENI to a
replacement instance.

ENIs allow you to create a management network, use network and security appliances in your
Amazon VPC, create dual-homed instances with workloads/roles on distinct subnets, or
create a low-budget, high-availability solution.
